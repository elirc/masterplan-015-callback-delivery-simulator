# M015: agentic engineering practice

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

These prompts are saved for you to run later with an assistant of your choice. They do not invoke a model, spend API credits or document a debate that already occurred. The core skill is controlling scope, supplying evidence and judging the result. More assistant messages do not automatically produce more understanding.

For this project, keep returning to this source-grounded model: A scheduled callback is future work, not a result that already exists. Cancellation therefore has two parts: ask the scheduler to remove work and make any stale callback harmless if it still arrives. A run-specific closure distinguishes old work from a new run. Deterministic tests can deliver captured callbacks in any order without pretending to simulate real elapsed time.

## Prompt 01: Contract interviewer

**Prepare:** Paste the current contract and one example you cannot classify.

```text
Project: Callback Delivery Simulator. Main skill: Execution order and delayed work.
Core reading anchor: public/core.js / deliveryRun.
Current contract: A run emits start and scheduled synchronously, then delivers B before A using delayed callbacks. A may produce a simulated callback error without suppressing B. Starting again or resetting cancels the old timers and marks the old run inactive so an already queued callback cannot append stale output. Timing is injected for deterministic unit tests; the model is local and makes no network-delivery guarantees.
My own attempt, relevant source and observed evidence: [fill in].
I will describe the user outcome. Ask one question about an ambiguous boundary, then wait for my decision.
Stay within this repository and the selected exercise. Do not claim tests,
edits or external facts that you have not actually checked. End with one
small next action that I can perform and verify myself.
```

**Judge the response:** A useful reply exposes a choice; it does not silently add requirements.

Before accepting advice, restate it in your own words and predict its consequence for one existing example. If you cannot do that, request a smaller explanation instead of pasting a patch. Record whether the assistant gave a hypothesis, a proposed check or a verified observation; those are different kinds of contribution.

## Prompt 02: Source-reading tutor

**Prepare:** Paste a short source excerpt and your current explanation.

```text

Current contract: A run emits start and scheduled synchronously, then delivers B before A using delayed callbacks. A may produce a simulated callback error without suppressing B. Starting again or resetting cancels the old timers and marks the old run inactive so an already queued callback cannot append stale output. Timing is injected for deterministic unit tests; the model is local and makes no network-delivery guarantees.
My own attempt, relevant source and observed evidence: [fill in].
Ask me to predict one step in deliveryRun. Give a small hint only after I attempt it.

## A three-role review you can run later

Use a proposer, a challenger and an adjudicator as distinct conversational roles. The proposer states the contract and a small design. The challenger supplies counterexamples and costs. The adjudicator asks which claims can be tested and what the result would mean. These roles may be played by separate assistants or by people; agreement among them is not the acceptance criterion.

Start with the design question “Which part of the test models order, and which part deliberately does not model elapsed time?”. Give every role the same current source and constraints. Do not ask for hidden internal reasoning; ask for concise design rationales, assumptions, alternatives and evidence that you can inspect.

A useful round ends with one of three outcomes: retain the design with supporting evidence; change one bounded choice because a counterexample demonstrated a failure; or record an unresolved question and an experiment. Avoid endless argument over abstractions whose cost has not appeared in this small project.

## Keep execution separate from suggestion

If an assistant can edit files, first constrain the patch to your selected story and name the checks it should run. Inspect the diff afterward. If the assistant only gives text, do not copy its imagined terminal output into your verification record. Run the commands yourself and keep the real result.

## Reduce assistance over repeated attempts

First attempt: ask for one vocabulary hint. Second attempt: ask for a counterexample. Third attempt: implement a small variation without generated code and request only review. You may need more rounds for a difficult concept; the goal is honest progress toward independence, not pretending you needed no help.
