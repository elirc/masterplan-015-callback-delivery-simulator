# Code tour and architecture decisions

[Overview](../README.md) · [Concepts](02-CONCEPTS-AND-TRACES.md)

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [package.json](../package.json) | Names the module format, Node requirement and local commands; private prevents npm publication. |
| [.github/workflows/check.yml](../.github/workflows/check.yml) | Runs the committed checks on GitHub. A workflow file is not evidence that a remote run succeeded. |
| [public/index.html](../public/index.html) | Semantic content, controls and explicit IDs. |
| [public/style.css](../public/style.css) | Presentation, focus indication and project-specific layout. |
| [tools/serve.mjs](../tools/serve.mjs) | Local preview infrastructure; only public/ is served. |
| [tools/check-site.mjs](../tools/check-site.mjs) | Checks referenced local assets exist, without pretending to judge usability. |
| [public/core.js](../public/core.js) | The main input/output rule; no DOM access. |
| [public/app.js](../public/app.js) | Browser events, parsing, rendering and visible errors. |
| [test/core.test.js](../test/core.test.js) | Independent boundary examples for the core contract. |

## Follow one path, not every file

Start at [public/core.js](../public/core.js) and locate `deliveryRun`. Use this trace as a map: Start click clears old run → deliveryRun emits start → schedules A at 80 ms then B at 20 ms → emits scheduled → synchronous call returns → B callback emits delivery → A callback emits delivery or a caught simulated error.

The tooling is intentionally separate from the product concept. You can study the local server or CI after the main rule is clear. Neither an HTTP preview server nor a workflow configuration should become a prerequisite for understanding an inline-block box or a small pure function.

## Decision: Inject the scheduler

The core receives schedule and cancel functions. The browser supplies timers; tests collect callback jobs and invoke them in controlled order. This avoids tests that depend on sleeping for an exact amount of wall time. The fake scheduler still honors the asynchronous contract by not invoking callbacks during scheduling.

**Review question:** Which part of the test models order, and which part deliberately does not model elapsed time?

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Decision: Guard canceled runs as well as timers

Clearing timers is the normal cancellation mechanism, but the active flag also rejects a callback the test delivers after cancellation. It makes the desired stale-output rule observable independently of scheduler behavior. Each start owns its own flag and stop function; a new run must not reactivate an old one.

**Review question:** Why is one global boolean shared by every run weaker than one closure per run?

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Decision: Catch failure inside the callback

A try/catch around scheduling would finish before the delayed callback throws. The reference catches the simulated error at the actual execution boundary and emits a diagnostic row. It does not promise to recover from a broken emit adapter; that adapter is supplied by the application and expected to work.

**Review question:** Where must a catch sit to observe an exception thrown later?

**Your alternative:** Write a plausible different choice, then give a concrete example that reveals its cost. “More scalable” or “cleaner” is not enough; identify a changed dependency, a new state to manage, or a user-visible failure mode.

## Change boundaries

A small change should begin in the file that owns its meaning. Change domain rules in the core, wording and interaction in the browser adapter, and layout in the relevant CSS rule. For the static references, semantic information belongs in HTML before styling. For the Git reference, the staged snapshot boundary belongs in the helper rather than being guessed from editor state.

If a story crosses two files, say why. A new unit, weather option or UI station may require a contract, a control and tests to change together. That is a coherent feature boundary, not permission to rewrite unrelated parts of the project.

## Deliberate limits

Persistence and frameworks are explicit where used: M019 saves a namespaced local draft; M024–M025 introduce React. The remaining builds use plain JavaScript and local data. M025 saved definitions last for the current session only. The preview server is a local development aid, not a production hosting system. A browser screenshot is one observation, not proof of every device or assistive technology. Keep these limits visible when describing your own work.
