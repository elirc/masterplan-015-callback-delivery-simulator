# M015: foundations clinic

[Expanded workshop map](WORKBOOK-INDEX.md) · [Repository overview](../README.md)

A scheduled callback is future work, not a result that already exists. Cancellation therefore has two parts: ask the scheduler to remove work and make any stale callback harmless if it still arrives. A run-specific closure distinguishes old work from a new run. Deterministic tests can deliver captured callbacks in any order without pretending to simulate real elapsed time.

## Start from one visible behavior

Read this contract slowly: A run emits start and scheduled synchronously, then delivers B before A using delayed callbacks. A may produce a simulated callback error without suppressing B. Starting again or resetting cancels the old timers and marks the old run inactive so an already queued callback cannot append stale output. Timing is injected for deterministic unit tests; the model is local and makes no network-delivery guarantees.

Underline the promised result, circle the input boundary and mark the stated limitation. A junior developer often starts by naming a framework or file. Start instead with an observation that a user could confirm or reject. File names become useful after you know which responsibility you are looking for.

## Clinic 1: Scheduling

Registering work to run later.

**Small experiment:** Separate registration order from completion order.

Find the part of `deliveryRun` or its surrounding adapter that makes this idea observable. Read no more than one small responsibility at a time. Write the value or structure before the operation, the operation itself and the value or structure afterward. If this is a layout observation, use the containing box, matching rule and resulting arrangement instead of inventing a JavaScript variable.

### Predict before inspecting

Write one ordinary example and one example that makes the distinction matter. Give an expected result for each. The second example should separate two plausible implementations; simply changing a name or color may leave both candidates behaving identically. Explain why your chosen variation is informative.

### Build a tiny explanation

Explain **scheduling** in three sentences: what problem it names, where you can see it in this repository, and what would go wrong if you ignored it. Avoid replacing the explanation with a slogan such as “best practice.” A concrete input, property or event should appear in at least one sentence.

### Repeat with less support

Close this paragraph, revisit the source and reconstruct the explanation without copying. Then deliberately change one assumption and predict which part of the explanation must change. Record the first point where you become uncertain. That point is a better question for a mentor than asking for another complete tour of the entire project.

**Checkpoint question:** How would you teach this distinction using only the experiment “Separate registration order from completion order.”? Leave your answer in the session journal before reading the mentor hints.

## Clinic 2: Run identity

The particular invocation whose output is still relevant.

**Small experiment:** Draw two active flags from two runs.

Find the part of `deliveryRun` or its surrounding adapter that makes this idea observable. Read no more than one small responsibility at a time. Write the value or structure before the operation, the operation itself and the value or structure afterward. If this is a layout observation, use the containing box, matching rule and resulting arrangement instead of inventing a JavaScript variable.

## Clinic 3: Cancellation guard

A check that makes stale callbacks do nothing.

**Small experiment:** Invoke a captured callback after stop in a fake scheduler.

Find the part of `deliveryRun` or its surrounding adapter that makes this idea observable. Read no more than one small responsibility at a time. Write the value or structure before the operation, the operation itself and the value or structure afterward.

## Clinic 4: Error boundary

The point where a thrown failure can be caught.

**Small experiment:** Put the catch around delayed execution rather than only registration.

## Read a real source window

The following is an excerpt from [public/core.js](../public/core.js), beginning at source line 1. It is a reading window, not a standalone runnable exercise. Open the linked file for surrounding declarations and context.

```js
// Inject timing so unit tests can deliver callbacks in a chosen order.
export function deliveryRun({ schedule, cancel, emit, failA = false }) {
  let active = true;
  const handles = [];
  emit('start');
  for (const job of [{ id: 'A', delay: 80 }, { id: 'B', delay: 20 }]) {
    handles.push(schedule(() => {
      if (!active) return;
      try {
        if (job.id === 'A' && failA) throw new Error('simulated failure');
        emit(`delivered ${job.id}`);
      } catch (error) { emit(`error ${job.id}: ${error.message}`); }
    }, job.delay));
  }
  emit('scheduled');
  return () => { active = false; handles.forEach(cancel); };
}
```

For each meaningful line, label its job as input interpretation, validation, state ownership, transformation, output or presentation. Some files contain only a subset of those jobs. Do not force the categories onto code that does not perform them. A closing brace is structure, not a separate business rule.

Choose one expression and restate it as a question the program answers. Then choose one expression that merely carries out a consequence of that answer. This separates a product decision from mechanical plumbing. If you cannot explain an operator, isolate a tiny example rather than rewriting the whole function.

## A three-column scratch sheet

| Before | Rule or operation | After |
|---|---|---|
| Write an actual supported input or layout situation | Name the owning function, property or event | Predict the concrete result |
| Change one assumption | State which rule now matters | Predict what changes and what remains stable |
| Use an invalid, missing or unsupported case | Identify the boundary that rejects or handles it | Predict feedback and retained state |

Do not fill the After column by running the reference first. That turns prediction practice into transcription. After predicting, observe the program and put discrepancies in a fourth note below the table. A wrong prediction is useful when you can name the mistaken assumption.

## What understanding looks like

You can locate `deliveryRun`, explain why the adapter has a separate job, and produce a new counterexample without borrowing one from the tests. You can also say what the reference deliberately does not support. If one of those is missing, choose the smallest clinic above that addresses it and repeat that clinic with different data.
